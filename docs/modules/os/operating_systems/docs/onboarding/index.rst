Onboarding and Promotion
========================

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   Template <os_onboard_template>

This page describes how OSs are added and promoted.

The process requirements are defined in :ref:`platform_assumptions`.

Principle
---------

Promotion has two phases:

1. **Eligibility (OS Maintainer)**:
   The operating system maintainer resolves the **supplier** requirements of the target level.
   Only if these requirements are fulfilled, the OS can be considered for promotion.

2. **Acceptance + Lifecycle Guarantees (S-CORE)**:
   S-CORE reviews the promotion request.
   If accepted at **Functional** or **Certifiable**, S-CORE commits to maintain the
   guarantees of the accepted level across all increments.

Community Level Onboarding
--------------------------

**What it means**
  In-tree best-effort integration.
  S-CORE provides no guarantees.

**Eligibility requirements (OS Maintainer / supplier requirements)**
  The OS maintainer must fulfill the Community level supplier requirements as defined in:
  :ref:`platform_assumptions`.

**Review and acceptance (S-CORE)**
  S-CORE reviews the documentation entry for completeness and consistency.
  Acceptance only means the operating system is listed in-tree.
  No infrastructure or lifecycle support is implied.

Promotion to Functional
-----------------------

**What it means**
  S-CORE provides functional guarantees for the accepted reference integration and
  maintains them across all increments.

**Eligibility requirements (OS Maintainer / supplier requirements)**
  The operating system maintainer must fulfil the Functional level supplier requirements as defined in:
  :ref:`platform_assumptions`.

**Additional acceptance requirements (S-CORE / system integrator requirements)**
  From Functional level onwards, S-CORE must be able to continuously validate the operating system.
  This requires infrastructure and test integration.

**Required approvals**
  Promotion to Functional requires explicit approval by:

* OS maintainers
* Architecture WG
* Infrastructure WG (CI / build & test environment support)
* Testing WG
* Release Team
* Quality Management

Promotion to Certifiable
------------------------

**What it means**
  S-CORE provides certifiability-oriented guarantees for the accepted reference integration
  and maintains them across all increments.

**Eligibility requirements (OS Maintainer / supplier requirements)**
  The operating system maintainer must fulfill the Certifiable level supplier requirements as defined in:
  :ref:`platform_assumptions`.

**Additional acceptance requirements (S-CORE / system integrator requirements)**
  Certifiable level implies additional safety/security expectations and evidence handling.

**Required approvals**
  Promotion to Certifiable requires explicit approval by:

* OS module maintainers
* Architecture WG
* Infrastructure WG
* Testing WG
* Quality Management
* Safety Manager
* Security Manager

Demotion
--------

If the eligibility requirements or the S-CORE lifecycle guarantees of an accepted operating system
can no longer be maintained, the operating system must be demoted to the highest level that can be
sustained.

Onboarding Template
-------------------

Use the :doc:`onboarding template document <os_onboard_template>` as the starting point to add a new operating system to
one of the levels, as described in the previous sections of this document.
