   The module "OS" is not a part of the S-CORE SW-Platform, but it is a crucial external SW element.
   Its components are modelled in S-CORE to be able to describe dependencies of S-CORE features to this external component.
   As it is external to S-CORE, the (folder/file) structure of the documentation may be different from the other modules.
   Its main content is the operating system environment (sometimes also already called a "SW platform").
   But also other SW components are modelled as a part of it as these are often provided by the "OS" supplier.
   One example of these "other" SW components are the C/C++ libs which may come from a processor manufacturer instead.
   S-CORE expects to support integration of more than one operating system, so these may be seen already in this module view,
   as different components. Requirements on this OS integration are documented in :need:`doc__os_requirements`.
