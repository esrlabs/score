Vulnerability Management / Platform Vulnerability Management Plan
-----------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::
   **Process Integration Summary**

   Vulnerability management in S-CORE is fully integrated with the :doc:`problem_resolution` process.
   All vulnerabilities are tracked as **security** problems through GitHub Issues following the standardized
   Problem Resolution workflow: **Create** → **Analyze** → **Implement** → **Close**.

   This integration provides:

   * Unified tracking for all project problems including vulnerabilities
   * Consistent workflow with clear roles (:need:`rl__committer`, :need:`rl__contributor`)
   * Standardized templates (:need:`gd_temp__problem_template`) and checklists (:need:`gd_chklst__problem_cr_review`)
   * Traceability through GitHub Issues and linked Pull Requests
   * Status visibility via GitHub Projects dashboard

   See :need:`doc__platform_problem_resolution_plan` for complete workflow details.

Purpose
+++++++

The main purpose of the vulnerability management plan is to:

* establish and maintain a systematic approach for managing vulnerabilities throughout the lifecycle of the S-CORE platform
* adhere to ISO SAE 21434 vulnerability management requirements where applicable
* ensure timely detection, analysis, and remediation of vulnerabilities


Objectives and Scope
++++++++++++++++++++

Vulnerability Management Goals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Proactive identification and management of vulnerabilities in the S-CORE platform
* Rapid response to discovered vulnerabilities with appropriate remediation actions
* Transparency in vulnerability handling aligned with Eclipse Foundation policies

Vulnerability Management Scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is no deviation from the scope presented in the `S-CORE project page <https://eclipse-score.github.io/>`_.
The vulnerability management applies to:

* All software components developed within the S-CORE platform
* Third-party dependencies and libraries integrated into the platform
* Build and development tools used in the platform development lifecycle
* Documentation and configuration artifacts that may have security implications

The platform and its components are developed and integrated for an assumed technical system as platform and components Out of Context (OoC).
Vulnerability management follows the defined processes and integrates with the security management system.

Regarding platform specifics:

* Vulnerabilities are classified by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on CVSS scores and platform-specific impact
* Security-relevant components receive priority attention in vulnerability scanning and remediation
* Platform-specific vulnerability management is coordinated through platform security plan
* Module-specific vulnerability management is coordinated through module security plans
* Dependencies are continuously monitored for known vulnerabilities using automated tools

Tailoring
^^^^^^^^^

Tailoring of vulnerability management activities:

* The tailoring is divided into project-wide and module-specific rules
* Project-wide tailoring is documented in this document based on platform OoC development
* Module OoC specific tailoring is documented in module development security plans
* Vulnerability management follows the Eclipse Foundation Security Policy (`Eclipse Foundation Security Policy <https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy/>`_) and procedures

The vulnerability management plan is aligned with ISO SAE 21434:

* Clause 8.4 - Vulnerability management activities
* Clause 8.5 - Continuous cybersecurity activities including vulnerability monitoring

Approach
++++++++

Vulnerability Management Culture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The S-CORE project embraces a culture of proactive vulnerability management and responsible disclosure.
Every contributor and committer is encouraged to report potential vulnerabilities through appropriate channels.
The project recognizes that vulnerabilities are an inherent aspect of software development and that transparent,
efficient handling builds trust with users and the broader community.

We foster an environment where security researchers and contributors are acknowledged for their
responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. The project commits to:

* Acknowledging vulnerability reports promptly
* Providing timely updates on remediation progress
* Learning from each vulnerability to improve development practices

As an Eclipse SDV project, S-CORE follows the `Eclipse CSI Security Handbook <https://eclipse-csi.github.io/security-handbook/>`_
which provides security guidelines specifically designed for automotive and Software Defined Vehicle contexts.
This includes enhanced focus on supply chain security, automated dependency management via Dependabot,
and strict branch protection requirements to ensure integrity and traceability of all code changes.

Vulnerability Management Organization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The vulnerability management organization aligns with the Eclipse Foundation structure and project roles defined in :doc:`security_management`.

*Eclipse Foundation Integration*

* `Eclipse Foundation Security Team <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#vulnerability-team>`_ provides guidance and coordinates vulnerability disclosure
* The `Eclipse Foundation Security Policy <https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy/>`_ governs vulnerability handling procedures
* Vulnerabilities are reported through the `Eclipse general vulnerability tracker <https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security>`_
* Critical vulnerabilities follow the Eclipse Foundation's security advisory process

*Project Roles*

* :need:`rl__security_manager` - Overall responsibility for vulnerability management coordination
* :need:`rl__project_lead` - Escalation point and resource allocation for critical vulnerabilities
* Committers - Responsible for implementing vulnerability fixes within their areas
* Module Security Managers - Coordinate vulnerability management for specific modules

*Vulnerability Response Team*

A dedicated vulnerability response team is established consisting of:

* Security Manager (lead)
* Affected module security managers
* Relevant committers with domain expertise
* Quality Manager for verification coordination
* Safety Manager for safety impact analysis (if applicable)


*Eclipse SDV Security Practices*

The S-CORE project follows the Eclipse CSI Security Handbook for Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) projects:

* **Branch Protection** - All release and main branches have protection enabled
* **Security-First Development** - Security integrated throughout development lifecycle
* **Supply Chain Security** - SBOM generation for all releases per :need:`wp__sw_platform_sbom`

Vulnerability Identification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multiple channels are established for vulnerability identification:

*Automated*

* **GitHub Dependabot** - Automated dependency vulnerability detection and update pull requests
* **GitHub Advanced Security** - Code scanning and secret scanning capabilities where available (CodeQL)


*Manual*

* Security code reviews as defined in :doc:`software_development`
* Security-focused verification activities per :doc:`software_verification`
* Architecture and design security reviews (by performing security analysis)

*External Reporting*

* Vulnerability reports from security researchers through Eclipse channels
* CVE monitoring for dependencies and related technologies
* Security advisories from upstream projects and suppliers
* Community-reported issues through GitHub issue tracking

Vulnerability Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All identified vulnerabilities undergo systematic analysis:

*Initial*

Upon identification, vulnerabilities are triaged within T.B.D. working days:

* Verification of the vulnerability (confirm exploitability and impact, if applicable)
* Initial severity assessment using CVSS v3.1 base metrics
* Affected module/component and version identification
* Assignment to vulnerability response team member

*Detailed*

For confirmed vulnerabilities, detailed analysis includes:

* CVSS v3.1 scoring
* Platform-specific impact analysis considering safety implications
* Attack vector and exploitability analysis
* Affected feature/component and module identification
* Dependency chain analysis for third-party vulnerabilities

*Severity Classification*

Vulnerabilities are classified according to CVSS scores and platform impact:

.. list-table:: Vulnerability Severity Classification
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 20 20 60

    * - Severity
      - CVSS Score
      - Characteristics

    * - Critical
      - 9.0 - 10.0
      - Remote code execution, authentication bypass, or impacts safety-critical functionality

    * - High
      - 7.0 - 8.9
      - Significant security impact, privilege escalation, or affects security mechanisms

    * - Medium
      - 4.0 - 6.9
      - Moderate impact, requires specific conditions to exploit, limited scope

    * - Low
      - 0.1 - 3.9
      - Minor impact, difficult to exploit, minimal security consequence

*Safety Impact Analysis*

For safety-relevant components (ASIL B), additional analysis addresses:

* Potential for vulnerability to cause hazardous behaviors
* Impact on safety mechanisms
* Interaction with functional safety requirements
* Need for safety-related remediation verification

Vulnerability Remediation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vulnerability remediation follows the Problem Resolution workflow as defined in
:need:`doc__platform_problem_resolution_plan` with security-specific adaptations.

*Remediation Timelines*

Remediation Time Lines are based on vulnerability severity (mapped to problem classification):

.. list-table:: Vulnerability Remediation Timelines and Problem Classification
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 15 15 20 25 25

    * - Severity
      - CVSS Score
      - Problem Label
      - Target Timeline
      - Actions

    * - Critical
      - 9.0 - 10.0
      - ``blocker``
      - 7 days (T.B.D.)
      - Immediate response team activation, emergency patch, coordinated disclosure

    * - High
      - 7.0 - 8.9
      - ``critical``
      - 30 days (T.B.D.)
      - Prioritized fix development, regular status updates, planned release

    * - Medium
      - 4.0 - 6.9
      - ``major``
      - 90 days (T.B.D.)
      - Scheduled fix in upcoming release, documented workarounds if available

    * - Low
      - 0.1 - 3.9
      - ``minor``
      - 180 days or next major release (T.B.D.)
      - Addressed in regular development cycle, may be combined with other fixes

*Workarounds and Mitigations*

When immediate fixes are not feasible:

* Document and communicate workarounds to affected users
* Implement temporary mitigations to reduce risk
* Update platform security manual with guidance
* Plan permanent fix for future release

Vulnerability Tracking and Reporting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vulnerabilities are managed through the S-CORE :doc:`problem_resolution` process.
Each identified vulnerability is treated as a security problem and follows the established
Problem Resolution workflow defined in :need:`doc__platform_problem_resolution_plan`.

This ensures the integration with the existing project management infrastructure.

*Tracking System*

All vulnerabilities are tracked using GitHub Issues as the **ONLY** mechanism per Problem Resolution process:

* **GitHub Issues** - Primary tracking system:

  * Issue type: Problem Report with type ``Security Vulnerability``
  * Labels: T.B.D. ``security``, ``vulnerability``, plus severity labels (``critical``, ``blocker``, ``major``, ``minor``)
  * Template: :need:`gd_temp__problem_template` extended with vulnerability-specific attributes
  * Workflow: Problem Resolution workflow (open → in review → in implementation → closed/rejected)
  * `Projects dashboard for visual tracking and status management <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/security/overview>`_
  * Linked PRs for remediation implementation tracking


*Reporting and Metrics*

Regular reporting includes:

* Weekly/Monthly (T.B.D.) vulnerability status in T.B.D. meetings

*Key Metrics*

* Number of vulnerabilities by severity and source

Vulnerability Disclosure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Responsible disclosure follows Eclipse Foundation policies.
